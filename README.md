🚨 BIG UPGRADE ALERT – Sean's OmniTag Processor just leveled up from Qwen 2.5 to **Qwen 3**! 🔥 
The old Qwen 2.5 was already savage.  
Now running **Qwen3-VL-8B-Abliterated-Caption-it** → captions are noticeably sharper, more exhaustive, better object counting, spatial reasoning, fewer hallucinations, and even less censored.  
Same VRAM footprint, way better "clinical / unfiltered / zero-BS" detail.

Tired of weak, lazy, censored captions for your LoRAs / datasets?  
Say hello to **uncensored clinical detail** powered by **Qwen3-VL-8B-Abliterated-Caption-it** in ComfyUI.

✨ **What OmniTag does in one click:**

💾 **How to use (super easy on Windows):**

1. Right-click your folder/video in File Explorer  
2. Choose **Copy as path**  
3. Click the text field in OmniTag → Ctrl+V to paste  
4. Press Queue Prompt → get PNGs/MP4s + perfect .txt captions ready for training!

🖼️📁 **Batch Folder Mode**  
→ Throw any folder at it (images + videos mixed)  
→ Captions EVERY .jpg/.png/.webp/.bmp  
→ Processes EVERY .mp4/.mov/.avi/.mkv/.webm as segmented clips  
→ Middle-frame Qwen3 captioning + optional Whisper audio transcript appended

🎥 **Single Video File Mode**  
→ Pick one video → splits into short segments  
→ Optional Whisper speech-to-text at the end of every caption

🎛️ **Everything is adjustable sliders**  
• Resolution (256–1920)  
• Max tokens (512–2048)  
• FPS output  
• Segment length (1–30s)  
• Skip frames between segments  
• Max segments (up to 100!)  

🔊 **Audio superpowers**  
• Include original audio in output clips? (Yes/No)  
• Append transcribed speech to caption end? (Yes/No)  

🧠 **Clinical / unfiltered / exhaustive mode by default**  
Starts every caption with your trigger word (default: ohwx)  
Anti-lazy retry + fallback if model tries to be boring

Perfect for building high-quality LoRA datasets, especially when you want **raw, detailed, uncensored descriptions** without fighting refusal.



Works with 4-bit quantized Qwen3-VL-8B (≈10–14 GB VRAM)
